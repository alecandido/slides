# Templates - reveal.js
Since *reveal.js* is a framework is more difficult to use as a dependency, so
I'm creating this `make.py` script to build my customize framework, copying the
submodule, that will help to keep *reveal.js* up to date with the original
developed version.

## How to use
download updated version of *reveal.js* and build the framework with my
customization
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
python3 make.py
```

## Presentation

### How to build a presentation
Compile the `index.html` from files in `src` and bundle the javascript with
`webpack` (including everything coming from *reveal.js*), all with the specific
script.

### How to build a presentation release
Use the build script, it will provide a folder containing:

- the `index.html` entry page (that is the unique `html` content of the output)
- the `main.js` bundle generated by `wepback`
- the `main.css` bundle generated someway (`sass`)
- a tar gzipped archive, made with all the source used to produce that
    presentation (contained in the `src` folder of the framework)
